    "#Goal: Assess whether the number of Units per zip code is a good predictor of citibike trips originating from that zip code.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Motivation: \n",
    "CitiBike must distribute bike hubs efficiently. In order to do so it needs a good predictor of the number of rides originating from a location. It is a reasonable assumption that a lot of riders ride from home to their destination. It is also reasonable to assume that if the bikes are far from one's residence the rider would be discouraged from taking a bike.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Method: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) __Fit__ BOTH a first and second degree linear model  (a line and a parabola) to the number of rides per zip code (this is your dependent variable) as a function of number of Residential Units in that zip code (this is your independent variable). \n",
    "\n",
    "2) __Display__ your fits graphically with a plot. Describe your plot with a Caption in cell of the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3) __Compare__ you regression with a 1-degree polynomial to your regression with a 2-degree polynomial and __test__ (with the appropriate statistical test) which is better. \n",
    "\n",
    "4) Since points at the edge of the x range have a lot of \"leverage\" (have a large influence on your test) if you find that there are suspicious points at the limit of the independent variable that could be outliers make cuts that remove those points and redo the fits with the 1- and 2-degree polynomial, and test which is better as you did before with a statistical test\n",
    "\n",
    "5) __Please state in words your findings__. \n",
    "State in words the general quality of your prediction. You do not need to be rigorously stating your level of confidence, but do justify your level of belief in your best regression model, and if it seems a good idea to reduce the x range (remove suspicious outliers). \n",
    "\n",
    "6) __Discuss__ if the test could be improved: the number of residential units may be a good predictor under specific circumstances (restricting your dataset by any variable, eg only certain times, days, areas, what do you think?), and if you have time test these other hypothesis (for extra credit). Try and imagine what variable could be a better predictor (and if you have time test other vatiables also for extra credit)."

I would group the data differentyly, maybe per group of BBLs encompassing a smaller area than a ZIP. In terms of predictor on a standalone basis, maybe population density could be more accurate than total number of residential units, as our focus is the potential number of citibike riders. Another crucial factor is that we are not taking into consideration the presence of citibike stations where people actually leave, which largely influences their decision to use the service. Lastly, the time is also crucial: people are more prone to take bikes close to where they live in the morning (or so I suppose!) "

Our R2 continues not to show improvement vs the uncut data, which I find counter-intuitive. "
